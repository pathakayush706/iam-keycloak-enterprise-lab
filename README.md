# IAM Enterprise Lab – Keycloak

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on implementation of Identity and Access Management (IAM) concepts using Keycloak.
The goal is to simulate real enterprise IAM scenarios such as RBAC, MFA, and OIDC-based Single Sign-On, along with common identity failure cases.

This project focuses on understanding IAM concepts and security behavior rather than only tool configuration.

## Technologies Used
- Keycloak (Open Source IAM)
- Docker
- OIDC (OpenID Connect)
- MFA (OTP-based)
- SAML (basic understanding)

## IAM Capabilities Implemented
- User provisioning and basic lifecycle management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Authentication flow customization
- MFA enrollment and enforcement
- OIDC-based Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Token and session validation
- IAM failure and recovery scenarios

## Enterprise IAM Scenarios Covered
- Least privilege access using RBAC
- MFA enforcement during authentication
- Secure OIDC SSO using Authorization Code Flow
- MFA device loss and recovery
- Redirect URI misconfiguration and resolution

## Status
- RBAC: Completed
- MFA: Completed
- OIDC SSO: Completed
- Failure Scenarios: Completed
- SAML: Basic configuration completed

## Disclaimer
This project is built for learning and demonstration purposes and does not represent a production deployment.
