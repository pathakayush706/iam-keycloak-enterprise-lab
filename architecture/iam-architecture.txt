Keycloak acts as a centralized Identity Provider handling authentication,
authorization, and session management.
Applications rely on Keycloak for identity verification and access decisions.

Realm Boundary Overview

- A dedicated application realm (IAM-LAB) was created to isolate identities,
  roles, and applications.
- The master realm was left unchanged to follow Keycloak best practices.
- This separation mirrors tenant-based identity boundaries used in
  enterprise IAM platforms such as Azure Entra or Okta.
