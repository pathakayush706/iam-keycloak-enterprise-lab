## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Created realm roles: admin, editor, viewer.
- Assigned roles to users following the least privilege principle.
- Verified role mapping during user authentication and active sessions.
- Understood how RBAC controls authorization at the application level.

This lab demonstrates how identity roles are used to control access without hardcoding permissions in applications.
