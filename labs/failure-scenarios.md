## IAM Failure Scenarios

### Redirect URI Misconfiguration
- Intentionally misconfigured redirect URI for the OIDC client.
- Observed authentication failure during login.
- Understood why strict redirect URI validation is required.
- Corrected configuration and restored successful SSO.

This scenario maps to real-world IAM issues commonly seen in Azure Entra and other identity providers.
